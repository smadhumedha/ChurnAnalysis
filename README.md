<h2>About Project</h2>
<p>Customer churn, the rate at which customers discontinue business with an online store, profoundly impacts revenue streams, emphasizing the significance of retaining existing clientele over acquiring new ones, thereby maximizing resource efficiency through predictive modeling.</p>

<p>By adeptly identifying and forecasting customer churn, e-commerce enterprises can implement preemptive strategies to preserve their valuable customer base.</p>

<p>The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model using ML algorithms for analyzing customer turnover in the E-comm industry.</p>

<h3>Objectives:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Identify the key features that impact customer turnover in E-commerce.</li>
  <li>Determine the optimal algorithm from RF and LR for accurately predicting customer churn through thorough evaluation of performance metrics.</li>
  <li>Formulate customer retention strategies based on insights gleaned from the analysis.</li>
</ol>
